# Ethereum Utils CLI

This package is a CLI of development utils for things I wish I had available while working on Ethereum projects.

## Checksummed Address Generator

Creates a random Ethereum address that is Checksummed

### Todo

- [ ] Orgaize structs into separate library file
- [ ] Create an executable pipeline with a [symlink](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60944480/how-do-i-make-a-rust-program-which-can-be-executed-without-using-cargo-run)

- [x] Add Checksum
- [x] Add Clap for CLI Parsing
- [x] Get better descriptions for address Parsing
- [x] Randomise colors

### Ideas for Functionality
- [x] Get whale for token list
- [x] Env Vars
- [x] Pass token address as params in CLI
- [x] Fetch token metadata and attach to JSON file
- [x] Let user choose the JSON filename
- [x] Write to json file
